# PlacementPredict

This code is used to determine the placement data of a student based on the training data provided.The Algorithm used here is Logistic Regression.

What is logistic regression? 

It is a classification not a regression algorithm. It is used to estimate discrete values (Binary values like 0/1, yes/no, true/false) based on given set of independent variables. In simple words, it predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logit function. Hence, it is also known as logit regression. Since, it predicts the probability, its output values lies between 0 and 1 (as expected).
